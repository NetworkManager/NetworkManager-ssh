NetworkManager-ssh-1.2.8 (not released yet)
Overview of changes since NetworkManager-ssh-1.2.6
==========================================================

* libnm-glib compatibility (NetworkManager < 1.0) is disabled by default.
  It can be enabled by passing --with-libnm-glib to configure script.
  Nobody should need it by now. Users that still use this are encouraged
  to let us know before the libnm-glib support is removed for good.
* The auth helper in external UI mode can now be run without a display
  server. Future nmcli version will utilize this for handling the
  secrets without a graphical desktop.
